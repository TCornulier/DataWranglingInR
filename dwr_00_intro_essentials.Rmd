## Intro

This lecture covers what I consider to be essential skills to be an efficient and productive user of R and RStudio. I don't claim this is comprehensive or official. 

I simply provide this in the hopes it will help you work smarter, not harder.

All keyboard shortcuts refer to RStudio.

## Creating an R Script

You can use R interactively, entering one line at a time in the console. But you'll eventually want to save that code and be able to run it again, or at least review it.

An R script is just a text file with a .R extension.

`Ctrl + Shift + N` will start a new script on a PC.
`Command + Shift + N` will start a new script on a Mac.

Be sure you know how to start and save an R script. I will ask you to turn in R scripts for assignments.

## Submitting code from a script

To submit code from a script to the console, place your cursor in the line of code you want to submit and hit `Ctrl + Enter`, or `Command + Enter` on a Mac.

You can also highlight multiple lines of code and use the same keyboard shortcut to submit the code. Tip: `Shift + down arrow` will highlight lines

To switch from script to console, type `Ctrl + 2`

To switch from console to script, type `Ctrl + 1`

## Comment your code

To add a comment to R code, enter a # followed by your comment. For example:

```{r}
# create vector of proportions
pr <- c(0.2,0.3,0.4,0.1)
```

RStudio displays comments in green font. 

To quickly comment/uncomment a block of text or code, highlight it and hit `Ctrl+Shift+C`, or `Command+Shift+C` on a Mac.

To re-flow comments (ie, automatically add line breaks), hit `Ctrl+Shift+/`, or `Command+Shift+/` on a Mac


## Your working directory

It's imperative you understand the concept of a working directory. 

Your working directory is where R looks for input files, and where it sends output files (unless you specify a path in your code). For example, the code:

`dat <- read.csv("file.csv")`

looks in your working directory for `file.csv`. For the code to work, you need to set your working directory to be the directory where that file is located.

## Setting your working directory - R code

The function to set your working directory is `setwd`. For example:

`setwd("~/_clients/Allen/")`

sets my working directory to the `Allen` folder, in the `_clients` folder, in _my computer's_ home directory.

The `~` means my computer's home directory. On Windows, this is usually `My Documents`.

## Setting your working directory - Completion

RStudio allows you to use Tab completion when working with directories and typing R code. Take advantage of this!

When setting your working directory:

- Type `setwd()` (notice RStudio automatically adds the closing parens)
- Type `""` in the parens (notice RStudio automatically adds the closing double-quote)
- Type `~` in the double quotes and hit Tab; you should see a selection of available directories in your computer's home directory.
- arrow up and down to find the desired directory and hit Tab.

## Setting your working directory - RStudio

You can set your working directory via point-and-click in RStudio by hitting `Ctrl + Shift + H`.

This is fine for an exploratory session or following along in class. But when you write a script, you'll want to be able to have a line of code that sets your working directory for you.

In this class I will provide you data sets for lectures and assignments. 

To follow along with lectures, you **must** know how to download the files and set your working directory to where you downloaded the files. 

My suggestion is to create a folder for this course and then create a subfolder called `data`.

## RStudio function completion

As I mentioned earlier, RStudio can auto-complete your typing.

Start typing a command and hit `Tab`. All functions in currently loaded packages that begin with the letters you typed will appear in a pick-list.

After you typed your command and opened a parens, hit `Tab` again. In most cases (not all) you will get a pick-list of arguments for that function.

Finally, typing `Alt + -` will insert the assignment operator: `<-`

## Using Help

All R users occasionally need help. Every last one. Know how to use R Help. 

`help(function)`  
`?function`

A help page for a function has the name of the function at the top left next to the package it's in. For example:

`ymd {lubridate}`

The function `ymd` is part of the _lubridate_ package. 

## Vignettes

Some packages come with _vignettes_, which are basically tutorials to help you get up and running with a package. 

These will be available on the package's index (or home) page through the link _User guides, package vignettes and other documentation._

If no vignette is available, check the package _DESCRIPTION file._ It will sometimes have a URL that serves as the home page for the package.

## Other keyboard shortcuts

Insert section header: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

Run the current section: `Ctrl + Alt + T`

Clear the console: `Ctrl + L`

Quickly create an R Notebook of your code: `Ctrl + Shift + K`

More RStudio Keyboard Shortcuts:  
`Alt + Shift + K`
